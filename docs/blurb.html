	<title>DS106's Indie Waves of Blog Syndication, Daily Creates, & an Open Assignment Bank Are Yours to Rock With as Templated WordPress Themes (proposal)</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Still going strong <a href="http://ds106.us/history">in it's 6th year as an open</a>, online course/community, the classic ed-tech groove of <a href="http://ds106.us/">DS106</a> included a <a href="http://ds106.us/flow">distributed network of participants united with RSS syndication</a>, an <a href="http://assignments.ds106.us/">open assignment bank</a> populated with response from the syndication, and <a href="http://daily.ds106.us/">a daily show of creative activities</a> that will on its 1975th episode by the time this conference rolls around.</p>

<p> Since then I and others have replicated <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2014/07/feed-wordpress-101/">the Feed Wordpress syndication model</a> in more class halls than we can count. Both the <a href="https://github.com/cogdog/dailyblank">DS106 Daily Creat</a>e and the <a href="https://github.com/cogdog/ds106bank">DS106 Assignment Bank</a> have been re-crafted into configurable Wordpress themes so anyone can create sites with the same functionality. </p>

<p>Learn about how these cover sites have done in different contexts and how you can set one up yourself. We'll give people <a href="https://connectedcourses.stateu.org">a hands on experience</a> rolling out one of these quickly within <a href="https://stateu.org">Reclaim Hosting's State U demo environment</a>. </p>
